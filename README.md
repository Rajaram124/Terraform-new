# Terraform-new

Terraform init
Terraform validate
Terraform plan
Terraform apply
Terraform show --> for state file

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

File system:
main.tf
output.tf
terraform.tfvars
variables.tf

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Terraform work spaces:
Main.tf        |
Dev.tfvars   |==> one statefile -> so if you run same main.tf file the state 
Stage.tfvars|        file will be overridden
Prod.tfvars  |

If you create ec2 var file for dev, then it will override the state file and create ec2 for dev env and delete the stageinstance

If they donâ€™t want to create diff. config files for diff env. There we use Terraform workspaces.
Terraform
| - dev --> state file
| - stage --> state file
| - prod  --> state file
